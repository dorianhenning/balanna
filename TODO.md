## Mesh Visualization

Features:
- [ ] single frame (simple example scene)
- [ ] single frame comparison between `N` number of resulting meshes (e.g., optimization)
- [x] sequence of single mesh
- [x] sequence of multiple meshes
- [x] uncertainty coloring of mesh?

## Pointcloud Visualization

Features:
- [x] single pointcloud of mesh
- [ ] uncertainty awareness/coloring of pointcloud

## Trajectory Plotting

- [ ] trajectory plotting over entire sequence
- [ ] trajectory plotting that is growing over sequence
- [ ] trajectory plot where the trajectory fades out (only last `N` frames)

## Image Keypoint Renderings

- [x] render/projection of set of points in color
- [x] projection of multiple different estimates of
  - [x] camera estimation
  - [x] posture/shape estimation
