## Mesh Visualization

Features:
- [x] single frame (simple example scene)
- [x] single frame comparison between `N` number of resulting meshes (e.g., optimization)
- [x] sequence of single mesh
- [x] sequence of multiple meshes
- [x] uncertainty coloring of mesh?

## Pointcloud Visualization

Features:
- [x] single pointcloud of mesh
- [ ] uncertainty awareness/coloring of pointcloud

## Trajectory Plotting

- [x] trajectory plotting over entire sequence
- [x] trajectory plotting that is growing over sequence
- [x] trajectory plot where the trajectory fades out (only last `N` frames)

## Image Keypoint Renderings

- [x] render/projection of set of points in color
- [x] projection of multiple different estimates of
  - [x] camera estimation
  - [x] posture/shape estimation

## Camera Round Flight
- [ ] stop scene and start camera round flight 

## Matplotlib
- [ ] add support for matplotlib axes (https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/user_interfaces/embedding_in_qt_sgskip.html)
